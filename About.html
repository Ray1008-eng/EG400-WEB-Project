       <h1>1.0 INTRODUCTION</h1>
        <p>
            A web-based water billing system is a software application that allows water service providers to manage their billing and collection processes online. It enables them to record, monitor, and update the water consumption and payment status of each client automatically, as well as generate invoices and reports. The main objective of this system is to give alternative convenient methods of web bill payment to clients as well as developing a user friendly website that will track and bill clients automatically. This will encourage water conservation, reduce payment disputes, and improve customer satisfaction.
            The web-based water billing system consists of two main components: the server side and the client side. The server side is responsible for storing and processing the data related to the water service, such as the meter readings, the billing rates, the payment history, and the customer information. The server side also provides a web interface for the water service provider to access and manage the data. The client side is the web browser that the tenants use to view their water bills, pay online, and communicate with the water service provider. The client side communicates with the server side through a secure and reliable internet connection.
            The web-based water billing system has several advantages over the traditional paper-based or manual billing system. First, it reduces the operational costs and errors associated with manual data entry, printing, mailing, and collection. Second, it increases the efficiency and accuracy of the billing process by automating the calculation of water charges and generating invoices and receipts. Third, it enhances the transparency and accountability of the water service by providing real-time information and feedback to both the water service provider and the tenants. Fourth, it improves the customer service and satisfaction by allowing tenants to access their water bills anytime and anywhere, pay online using various methods, and contact the water service provider easily.
        </p>
        <h1>2.1 MOTIVATION</h1>
        <p>
            The driving force behind the creation of a web-based water management and payment system is to meet the increasing demand for effective solutions in managing water resources. As the global population rises and urbanization expands rapidly, there is a growing need for efficient water management systems that can maximize the utilization of water resources, minimize water waste, and promote sustainable development.

                <h1>4.0 METHODOLOGY</h1>

                <p>A web-based water billing system can provide an efficient and convenient way for customers to view and pay their water bills online. This methodology will outline the steps involved in developing a web-based water billing system using a YS-F201 water flow sensor, Arduino Wi-Fi microprocessor, and a PC with a web server, PHP script, and MySQL database. 
                The hardware setup involves connecting the water flow sensor to the Arduino microprocessor and configuring the Arduino to connect to the Wi-Fi network and transmit data to the web server. The software setup involves installing and configuring a web server, PHP, and MySQL on a computer or server. The system design involves defining the requirements, designing the database schema, and creating a detailed project plan.</p>
